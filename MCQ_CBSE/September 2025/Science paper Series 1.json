    "options": {
      "A": "Black and white photography",
      "B": "Burning of carbon (coal)",
      "C": "Burning of methane",
      "D": "Refining of copper"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Burning of carbon in oxygen forms CO2 (C + O2 → CO2), which is a combination reaction. The other options involve decomposition or complex processes."

    "correct": "A",
    "explanation": "Image size = object size → magnification = −1. For concave mirror, this happens when object is at 2F. Since image is at −20 cm, focal length f = 10 cm, but concave mirror focal length is taken negative → −10 cm."

One of the wires in this supply, usually with red insulation, is called live wire and another wire with green insulation is called neutral wire.
