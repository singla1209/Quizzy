    "correct": "A",
    "explanation": "A combination reaction involves two or more reactants forming a single product. Only reaction III (2Na + O2 → Na2O2 or 4Na + O2 → 2Na2O) represents two elements combining to form one compound. The other reactions are displacement/redox (I, II) and combustion/redox (IV)."

    },
    "correct": "C",
    "explanation": "Turmeric is a natural indicator that turns red in basic (alkaline) solutions. Hydrochloric acid (A) and Lemon juice (D) are acidic. Distilled water (B) is neutral. Ammonium hydroxide (C) is a weak base, so it would cause the turmeric to turn red."

      "D": "Citric acid"
    },
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "Nettle leaves inject methanoic acid (also known as formic acid) when they touch the skin, causing a burning pain. The pain is treated by applying a mild base, like rubbing the area with a dock leaf."

    "explanation": "The reaction is: BaCl2(aq) + Na2SO4(aq) → BaSO4(s) + 2NaCl(aq). In this reaction, the ions are exchanged between the two reactant compounds to form two new products (barium sulphate and sodium chloride). The formation of the insoluble substance (BaSO4) is a precipitation reaction, which is a type of double displacement reaction."

    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "In this reaction: $\\text{CuO}$ loses oxygen to become $\\text{Cu}$, so $\\text{CuO}$ is **reduced**. $\\text{H2}$ gains oxygen to become $\\text{H2O}$, so $\\text{H2}$ is **oxidised**. The substance that causes reduction ($\\text{H2}$) is the **reducing agent**. The substance that causes oxidation ($\\text{CuO}$) is the **oxidising agent**."

    "correct": "D",
    "explanation": "For a real image with magnification $m = -1$, the object is placed at the **centre of curvature** ($C$). For a concave mirror, the centre of curvature is $C = 2f$. Given $f = 50 \\text{ cm}$, the object distance is $u = -100 \\text{ cm}$ and the image distance is $v = -100 \\text{ cm}$ (the image is also formed at $C$). Since the object and its image are at the same position, the distance between them is **Zero**."

      "D": "each appliance starts drawing more and more current from the source."
    },
    "correct": "C",
    "explanation": "When too many appliances are connected to a single socket, they are connected in parallel. This causes the **total resistance of the circuit to decrease** (A is false). According to Ohm's law ($I = V/R$), a decrease in total resistance leads to a **large increase in the current** drawn from the source (B is false), which can exceed the circuit's safe **rated value**, leading to **overloading** (C is correct). Each appliance draws its rated current, but the total current is too high (D is false)."

    "explanation": "**Biomagnification** (or bioaccumulation) is the increase in the concentration of **harmful, non-biodegradable chemicals** (like DDT or mercury) in the body of organisms at successively higher **trophic levels** of a food chain. This occurs because the chemical cannot be metabolised or excreted and its concentration builds up over time."
