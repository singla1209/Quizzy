"question": "Consider the following chemical equation: p Al + q H2O ⟶ r Al2O3 + s H2. To balance this chemical equation, the values of 'p', 'q', 'r' and 's' must be respectively:",
"options": {
"A": "3, 2, 2, 1",
"B": "2, 3, 3, 1",
"C": "2, 3, 1, 3",
"D": "3, 1, 2, 2"
},
"correct": "C",
"explanation": "Balance atoms: choose p=2 so Al: 2 → Al2O3 (r=1). For r=1, oxygen in Al2O3 is 3 → need q=3 H2O (3 O). q=3 gives 6 H atoms → s = 3 H2 molecules. Thus coefficients 2,3,1,3 (option C)."
